# Extended-Euclidean
C program implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to calculate the GCD of two integers, displaying the result as a linear combination along with a detailed step-by-step table of the algorithm.

Computes the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean Algorithm.
Utilizes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find coefficients 
𝑥 and 𝑦
y such that:
gcd(𝑎,𝑏)=𝑎*𝑥+𝑏*𝑦
Displays a step-by-step table showing the progression of the algorithm.
