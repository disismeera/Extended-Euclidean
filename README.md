# Extended-Euclidean
C program implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to calculate the GCD of two integers, displaying the result as a linear combination along with a detailed step-by-step table of the algorithm. <br>

Computes the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean Algorithm. <br>
Utilizes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find coefficients 𝑥 and 𝑦 such that: <br>
gcd(𝑎,𝑏)=𝑎*𝑥+𝑏*𝑦 <br>
Displays a step-by-step table showing the progression of the algorithm. <br>

**Input:** <br>
Two integers are provided by the user. <br> 
<br>

**Output:** <br>
- The GCD of the two integers. <br>
- A linear combination showing the relationship between the GCD and the input integers. <br>
- A detailed table showing each step of the algorithm. <br>
